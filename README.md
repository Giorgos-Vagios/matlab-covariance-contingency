# MATLAB Covariance & Contingency Coursework

This repository contains my MATLAB coursework for the *Computational Methods* module of my MSc in Advanced Information Systems.

## ðŸ“˜ Description
The project includes two exercises implemented in MATLAB:

### Exercise 1 â€” Covariance & Correlation
- Input: two vectors `x`, `y` representing GDP and Household Consumption for Greece (2012â€“2021).
- Output: 
  - Covariance **Cov(x,y)**  
  - Correlation coefficient **r**
- Dataset: 10 yearly values (2012â€“2021) in millions of euros.
- Goal: verify the linear relationship between GDP and Consumption.

### Exercise 2 â€” Contingency Tables
- Input: frequency matrix **X** (4Ã—5) for 200 employees and their seminar attendance/test performance.
- Output:
  - Marginal frequencies `ai`, `bj`
  - Expected frequencies **Y**
  - Pearsonâ€™s **C** and **Cmax**
- Goal: measure the strength of association between seminar attendance and test grades.
